## Loading and preprocessing the data
To begin the data must be downloaded in to the working directory.
``` {r download}
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip", 
              destfile = "data.zip")
unzip("data.zip")
```
The data was saved as activity.csv. The following code will then store the data into a data frame.
``` {r read}
actData <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, 
                    colClasses = c("integer", "Date", "integer"))
```

## Mean steps



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
